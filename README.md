Hello my name is Zachary Mankowitz. I am a CS major at Landmark College.
My primary coding skills are in C# and C++. I am also familiar with Java, Python, and MySQL.
I am able to use Unity and Blender for game design. I am also familiar with the github interface.
I can use the microsoft office suite.

This past summer (2022), I worked at ReGame-XR at Northeastern University, as part of a six person group.
I was one of the core programmers on the Rainbow Crystal Mining Adventure project, a game designed in Unity to be used for research purposes.
I used C# to code the essential aspects of the game such as player interactiability,
as well as keeping consistent frequency of crystal flashes in the game to meet the clients' (Ubisoft) request so that they could do data analysis.
I was in charge of merging the work that the designers and artists in the group into the project and implementing them into the game.
I created JSON files to store player information, such as name and score to be stored in the high score board at the end of the game,
as well as other more detailed information for each level to be sent to the clients.
A link to the finished project is below:

I will be adding more work.
