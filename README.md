# About Me
Hello my name is Zachary Mankowitz. I graduated Landmark College in December 2023 with a BS in computer science.
My primary coding skills are in C#, C++, Python, Java, and MySQL. I am also familiar with JavaScript, .Net, .css, and a few others.
I am able to use Unity and Blender for game design. I am also familiar with the github interface.
I can use the Microsoft Office Suite.

# Player Online Learning / Rainbow Crystal Mining Adventure
During summer (2022), I worked at ReGame-XR at Northeastern University, as part of a six person group.
I was one of the two core programmers on the Rainbow Crystal Mining Adventure project, a game designed in Unity to be used for research purposes.
I used C# to code the essential aspects of the game such as player interactiability,
as well as keeping consistent frequency of crystal flashes in the game to meet the clients' (Ubisoft) request so that they could do data analysis.
I was in charge of merging the work that the designers and artists in the group into the project and implementing them into the game.
I created JSON files to store player information, such as name and score to be stored in the high score board at the end of the game,
as well as other more detailed information for each level to be sent to the clients.

# Computer Science BS Capstone Project
My project is a standalone game in Python. In my repository it is titled Hyperclass.py.
If you want to view the code, open it in Idle (Python) or Visual Studio Code.
Otherwise if you want to play it, it is executible as long as you have python on your computer.
At the beginning of the code I initialize the possible ranks and suites of the playing cards for the Card War game.
I also initialize 3 maps for the Zork game: 1 for the complete map, 1 for the updatable map, and 1 for the default map when resetting.
The Hyperclass connects with the InteractionV1, CardWar, and ZorcGame classes and has functions to overwrite the user name and transition between the classes.
The classes that go with the 2 minigames are located above each the game classes for those games.
For the card game, there are classes to deal with initializing the cards and decks as well as handling moving the cards from the decks to the field and then to a player's discard as well as returning the discarded cards to the player's deck when its empty.
The classes for the zork game handle the map, the rooms on the map, the player, and the zorc.
The player and zorc have movement that relies on the room they are in.
Once a player escapes zorc successfully the game will end and display a different message dependant on how many multiple choice questions they answered since they last set their name.
There are comments in the code for other class interactions.
